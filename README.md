# Shopping Cart

Developed a fully functional shopping cart application using React, implementing client-side routing with React Router DOM for seamless navigation. The app efficiently manages state using hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext. Products are dynamically fetched from the Fake Store API. Used media queries to make the page responsive.
